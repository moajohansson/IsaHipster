\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}

In this section we give a brief overview of the HipSpec system which
we use as a backend for generating conjectures. HipSpec is a
state-of-the-art inductive theorem prover and theory exploration
system for Haskell. In \cite{hipspecCADE} we showed that HipSpec is
able to discover and prove the kind of equational lemmas present in
Isabelle's list library, when given list functions written in Haskell.

HipSpec works by first generating a set of conjectures about the
functions at hand. Its power comes from its capability to
automatically discover and prove lemmas, which are then used to help
subsequent proofs. In Hipster we are not interested in HipSpec's
proving capabilities: we use Isabelle for the proofs instead. Isabelle
is based on a small core of trusted axioms, and proofs must be built
on top of those axioms. In other words, we would have to reconstruct
inside Isabelle any proof we found anyway, so it is easier to use
Isabelle for the proofs in the first place. The part of HipSpec we use
is its conjecture synthesis system QuickSpec \cite{quickspec},
which efficiently generates equations about given functions and
datatypes.

QuickSpec takes a set of functions as input, and proceeds to generate all
type-correct terms up to a given limit (usually up to depth three), with
variables (usually three per type).  It first assumes that all terms the same
type are equivalent, and are initially put in the same equivalence class.  By
generating random values for the variables (using QuickCheck\cite{quickcheck}), the terms are repeatedly evaluated and their equivalence
classes are separated according to the evaluation results.  This process is
repeated until the equivalence classes stabilise, and resulting equations can
be read off from each equivalence class.  This means that the conjectures
generated are, although not yet proved, fairly likely to be true.

As an example, we tell QuickSpec to explore the theory with list append,
\verb~@~, the empty list, \verb~[]~, and three list variables \verb~xs~,
\verb~ys~, \verb~zs~. Some of all the terms it will generate are these:
\verb~(xs@ys)@zs~, \verb~xs@(ys@zs)~, \verb~xs@[]~ and simply \verb~xs~.
Initially, all four will be assumed to be in the same equivalence class.
Before soon, it will generate non-empty lists for \verb~ys~ and \verb~zs~.
Evaluating the terms with such assignments will split this equivalence class
into two: one with the former two and one with the latter. After this, more
values will be generated for these lists variables, but no evaluation will make
them split again. Eventually, QuickSpec stops and the equations for
associativity and right identity can be read off.
