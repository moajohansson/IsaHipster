The files in this directory were used to attain the results described in
the case-studies of our the paper
"Into the Infinite - Theory Exploration for Coinduction", currently under
submission and review for the AISC conference 2018.

The theory files belonging to each case-study in the paper are listed below
Section 5.1: Lazy_List.thy
Section 5.2: Hinze_Streams.thy
Section 5.3: CoBinaryTree.thy and RoseTree.thy

In each file, there are a number of calls to our tool (Hipster).
All lemmas and proofs tagged with [thy_expl] have been automatically generated
by the system. No proofs were done by humans.

To run the experiments, you will need to have Isabelle2017 and Hipster
installed. Please refer to the respective system's webpages for installation
